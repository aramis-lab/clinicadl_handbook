# # Generate synthetic dataset
# Previous sections were focusing on pre-built architectures available in
# ClinicaDL. These architectures were trained and validated on ADNI, and gave
# similar test results on ADNI, AIBL and OASIS. However, they might not be
# transferrable to other problems on other datasets using other modalities, and
# this is why may want to search for new architectures and hyperparameters.

# Looking for a new set of hyperparameters often means taking a lot of time
# training networks that are not converging. To avoid this pitfall, it is often
# advise to simplify the problem: focus on a subset of data / classification task
# that is more tractable than the one that is currently explored. This is the
# purpose of `clinicadl generate` which creates a set of synthetic, tractable data
# from real data to check that developed networks are working on this simple case
# before going further.

# With Clinicadl, you can generate three types of synthetic data sets for a binary classification depending on the option chosen: trivial, random or shepplogan.

# If you ran the previous notebook, you must have a folder called
# `CAPS_example` in the data_oasis directory (Otherwise uncomment the next cell
# to download a local version of the necessary folders).

# ## Generate trivial data

# Tractable data can be generated from real data with the following command line.
# This command generates a synthetic dataset for a binary classification task from a CAPS-formatted dataset. 
# It produces a new CAPS containing trivial data which should be perfectly classified by a classifier. Each label 
# corresponds to brain images whose intensities of respectively the right or left hemisphere are strongly decreased.
# Trivial data are useful for debugging a framework: hyper parameters can be more easily tested as fewer data samples 
# are required and convergence should be reached faster as the classification task is simpler.

# <img src="../../../images/generate_trivial.png" alt="generate trivial" style="height: 350px; margin: 10px; text-align: center;">

# ```{warning}
# You need to execute the `clinica run` and `clinicadl prepare-data` pipelines prior to running this task.
# Moreover, the trivial option can synthesize at most a number of images per label that is equal to the total number of images in the input CAPS.
# ```


# ###Running the task
# ```Text
# clinicadl generate trivial <caps_directory> <output_directory> --n_subjects <n_subjects>
# ```
# where:

# - `caps_directory` is the output folder containing the results in a [CAPS](http://www.clinica.run/doc/CAPS/) hierarchy.
# - `output_directory` is the folder where the synthetic CAPS is stored.
# - `n_subjects` is the number of subjects per label in the synthetic dataset. Default value: 300.

# ```{warning}
# `n_subjects` cannot be higher than the number of subjects in the initial
# dataset. Indeed in each synthetic class, a synthetic image derives from a real
# image.
# ```

# ### Reproduce the tsv file system necessary to train

# In order to train a network, meta data must be organized in a file system
# generated by `clinicadl tsvtools`. For more information on the following
# commands, please read the section [Define your
# population](./label_extraction.ipynb).
# %%
# Get the labels AD and CN in separate files
# This command need a Bids as argument in order to create the missing_mods_directory and the merged.tsv file
# but when you already have it, you can give an empty folder and the paths to the needed files.
# Be careful, the output of the command, labels.tsv is saved in the same folder as the bids.

# ## Train a model on synthetic data

# Once data was generated and split it is possible to train a model using
# `clinicadl train` and evaluate its performance with `clinicadl interpret`. For
# more information on the following command lines please read the sections [Classification with a CNN on 2D slice](./training_classification.ipynb) 
# and [Regression with 3D images](./training_regression.ipynb).

#The following command uses a pre-build architecture of ClinicaDL `Conv4_FC3`.
#You can also implement your own models by following the instructions of [this
#section](./training_custom.ipynb).

# For now, there is a mistake when you generate data because tensors are extracted but the extract.json file
# is not extracted whereas this file is needed when you want to train a network. So it is needed to copy the 
# JSON file from the data_oasis/CAPS_example. 
# The ClinicaDL team is aware of this problem and it will be solved in the next version.

# ## Generate random data

# This command generates a synthetic dataset for a binary classification task from a CAPS-formatted dataset. 
# It produces a new CAPS containing random data which cannot be correctly classified. All the images from this dataset 
# comes from the same image to which random noise is added. Then the images are randomly distributed between the two labels

# <img src="../../../images/generate_random.png" alt="generate random" style="height: 350px; margin: 10px; text-align: center;">

# ```{warning}
# You need to execute the `clinica run` and `clinicadl prepare-data` pipelines prior to running this task.
# Moreover, the random option can synthesize as many images as wanted with only one input image.
# ```
# %% [markdown]
# ###Running the task
# ```Text
# clinicadl generate random <caps_directory> <generated_caps_directory> 
# ```
# where:

# - `caps_directory` is the output folder containing the results in a [CAPS](http://www.clinica.run/doc/CAPS/) hierarchy.
# - `generated_caps_directory` is the folder where the synthetic CAPS is stored.

#%%

!clinicadl generate random data_oasis/CAPS_example data/CAPS_random


# %% [markdown]
# The command generates 3D images of same size as the input images formatted as NIfTI files. Then the `clinicadl prepare-data` command must be 
# run to use the synthetic data with ClinicaDL. Results are stored in the same folder hierarchy as the input folder.

# ## Generate shepplogan data

# This command is named after the Shepp-Logan phantom, a standard image to test image reconstruction algorithms.
# It creates three subtypes of 2D images distributed between two labels. These three subtypes can be separated according 
# to the Top (framed in blue) and Bottom (framed in orange) regions: 
# - subtype 0: Top and Bottom regions are of maximum size, 
# - subtype 1: Top region has its maximum size but Bottom is atrophied, 
# - subtype 2: Bottom region has its maximum size but Top is atrophied.

# <img src="../../../images/generate_shepplogan.png" alt="generate shepplogan" style="height: 350px; margin: 10px; text-align: center;">

# These three subtypes are spread between two labels which mimic the binary classification between Alzheimer's disease patients (AD) with 
# heterogeneous phenotypes and cognitively normal participants (CN). Default distributions are the following:

# | subtype |   0  |   1  |   2  |
# |---------|------|------|------|
# |    AD   |  5%  | 85%  | 10%  |
# |    CN   | 100% |  0%  |  0%  |

# The CN label is homogeneous, while the AD label is composed of a typical subtype (1), an atypical subtype (2) and normal looking images (0).
