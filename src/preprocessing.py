# # Prepare your neuroimaging data

# There are different steps to perform before training your model or performing
# classification. In this notebook, we will see how to:

# 1. **Organize** your neuroimaging data.
# 2. **Preprocess** your neuroimaging data.
# 3. Check the preprocessing **quality**.
# 4. **Prepare data** by extracting tensors from your preprocessed data.

# ## Organization of neuroimaging data: the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)

# Before processing your neuroimaging data, several steps may be needed. These
# steps can include converting the images to a format readable by neuroimaging
# software tools (e.g. converting to NIfTI) and organizing your files in a
# specific way. Several tools will require that your clinical and imaging data
# follow the **Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)** [(Gorgolewski et al.,
# 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.44). The BIDS standard is based on a
# file hierarchy rather than on a database management system, thus facilitating
# its deployment. Thanks to its clear and simple way to describe neuroimaging
# and behavioral data, it has been easily adopted by the neuroimaging community.
# Organizing a dataset following the BIDS hierarchy simplifies the execution of
# neuroimaging software tools.  

# Here is a general overview of the BIDS structure. If you need more details,
# please check the
# [documentation](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on the
# [website](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/).

# ## `clinica convert` pipelines
# 
# Both OASIS and ADNI dataset contain imaging data in ANALYZE format 
# and do not provide a BIDS version of the data. To solve this issue, 
# [clinica](https://aramislab.paris.inria.fr/clinica/docs/public/latest/) 
# provides a [converter](https://aramislab.paris.inria.fr/clinica/docs/public/latest/Converters/OASIS2BIDS/)
# to automatically convert ANALYZE files into NIfTI following the BIDS 
# standard.

# A command line instruction is enough to get the data in BIDS format:

# ```bash
# clinica convert oasis-to-bids <dataset_directory> <clinical_data_directory> <bids_directory>
# ```

# where:

#   - `dataset_directory` is the path to the original OASIS images' directory;
#   - `clinical_data_directory` is the path to the directory containing the
#   `oasis_cross-sectional.csv` file;
#   - `bids_directory` is the path to the output directory, where the
#   BIDS-converted version of OASIS will be stored.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Before starting
# We are going to run some experiments on the ADNI and OASIS datasets,
# if you have already downloaded the full dataset, you can set the
# path to your own directory when needed.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Run the pipeline
# To run this pipeline, you need clinical data. The next cell allows you to 
# download an example dataset with 4 images from OASIS.
# %%

# # Why prepare data ?
# Preprocessing of neuroimaging data is essential before doing any experiment 
# and especially before training a neural network with that data.
# - **Registration** helps to standardize the neuroimaging data so that it is 
# consistent across different subjects, scanners, and imaging modalities. This 

# makes it easier for the deep neural network to learn patterns and make
# accurate predictions. 
# - Preprocessing techniques such as **motion correction** and **noise
# reduction** can help to minimize sources of noise and improve the quality of 
# the data. Neuroimaging data can be noisy due to a variety of factors, such as 
# head motion, scanner artifacts, and biological variability. 
# - Preprocessing can also be used to **extract features** from the neuroimaging
# data that are relevant to the task at hand. For example, if the goal is to
# classify brain regions based on their functional connectivity, preprocessing
# may involve computing correlation matrices from the fMRI time series data. 
# - **Normalization** is another important preprocessing step for neuroimaging
# data that can help improve the performance of deep neural networks. 
#
# Overall, preprocessing is essential in preparing neuroimaging data for deep
# neural network training. By standardizing and improving the quality of the
# data, these steps help to ensure that the deep neural network can learn
# meaningful patterns and make accurate predictions.

# %% [markdown]

# Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have the potential to extract
# low-to-high level features from raw images, a proper image preprocessing
# procedure is fundamental to ensure a good classification performance (in
# particular for Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification where datasets are
# relatively small).  In the context of deep learning-based classification,
# image preprocessing procedures often include:
# - **Bias field correction:** MR images can be corrupted by a low frequency and
# smooth signal caused by magnetic field inhomogeneities. This bias field
# induces variations in the intensity of the same tissue in different locations 
# of the image, which deteriorates the performance of image analysis algorithms
# such as registration.
# - **Image registration:** Medical image registration consists of spatially
# aligning two or more images, either globally (rigid and affine registration)
# or locally (non-rigid registration), so that voxels in corresponding positions
# contain comparable information.
# - **Cropping**: some specific regions of the registered images are selected in
# order to remove the background and to reduce the computing power required
# when training deep learning models.

# ## Image preprocessing with the `t1-linear` pipeline
# For this tutorial, we propose a "minimal preprocessing" (as described in [(Wen
# et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2020.101694)) implemented in
# the [`t1-linear` pipeline](http://www.clinica.run/doc/Pipelines/T1_Linear/)
# using the [ANTs](http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/) software package [(Avants et
# al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2014.00044). This preprocessing
# includes:
# - **Bias field correction** using the N4ITK method [(Tustison et al.,
# 2010)](https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2010.2046908)
# - **Affine registration** to the MNI152NLin2009cSym template (Fonov et al.,
# [2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.07.033), 
# [2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1053-8119(09)70884-5) ) in MNI space with the
# SyN algorithm [(Avants et al.,
# 2008)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2007.06.004).
# - **Cropping** resulting in final images of size 169×208×179 with 1 mm3
# isotropic voxels.

# # Quality check of your preprocessed data

# %% [markdown]
# From the 2 visualizations above, we can see that after the preprocessing, some
# images have some missing skin voxels on top of the brain i.e. these images are
# slightly cropped.  Besides, we did not compare them to the [MNI152NLin2009cSym
# template](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/99-appendices/08-coordinate-systems.html)
# to evaluate the quality of the registration.

# OASIS-1 dataset contains 416 images and ADNI more than 3000, so the quality
# check of the entire datasets can be very time-consuming. The next section gives
# you some ideas on how to keep only the images correctly preprocessed when 
# working on a large dataset.

# %% [markdown]
# To automatically assess the quality of the **t1-linear** or the **pet-linear** preprocessing, we
# propose to use a pretrained network which learnt to classify images that are
# adequately registered to a template from others for which the registration
# failed. This procedure is adapted from [(Fonov et al,
# 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119266), using their
# pretrained models. The original code of [(Fonov et al,
# 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119266) can be found on
# [GitHub](https://github.com/vfonov/DARQ).

# The quality check can be run with the following command line:
# ```
# clinicadl quality-check <preprocessing> <caps_directory> <output_path>
# ```
# where:

# - `preprocessing` corresponds to the preprocessing pipeline whose outputs will
# be checked (`t1-linear` or `pet-linear` or `t1-volume`),
# - `caps_directory` is the folder containing the results of the preprocessing
# pipeline in a [CAPS](http://www.clinica.run/doc/CAPS/Introduction/) hierarchy,
# - `output_path` is the path to the output TSV file (or directory for
# `t1-volume`) containing QC results.

##
# ```{note}
# Quality checks pipelines are all different and depend on the chosen
# preprocessing. They should not be applied to other preprocessing procedures as
# the results may not be reliable.
# ```

# %% [markdown]
# ### Run the pipeline
