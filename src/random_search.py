# # Launch a random search
#
# The previous section focused on a way to debug non-automated architecture
# search. However, if you have enough computational power, you may want to
# launch an automated architecture search to save your time. This is the point
# of the random search method of ClinicaDL.

# ```{warning}
# **Non-optimal result:**
#     A random search may allow to find a better performing network, however
#     there is no guarantee that this is the best performing network.
# ```
#
# This notebook relies on the synthetic data generated in the previous notebook.
# If you did not run it, uncomment the following cell to generate the
# corresponding dataset.

# ## Define the hyperparameter space

# A random search is performed according to hyperparameters of the network that
# are sampled from a pre-defined space.  For example, you may want your random
# network to have maximum 3 fully-convolutional layers as you don't have enough
# memory to tackle more.

# This hyperparameter space is defined in a TOML file that must be written in
# your random search directory: `random_search.toml`.

# The following function `generate_dict` generates a dictionary that will be
# used to  `random_search.toml` for this tutorial. To accelerate the training
# task we will use a single CNN on the default region of interest, the
# hippocampi.

# In this default dictionary we set all the arguments that are mandatory for the
# random search. Hyperparameters for which a space is not defined will
# automatically have their default value in all cases.

# Hyperparameters can be sampled in 4 different ways:
# - choice samples one element from a list (ex: `first_conv_width`),
# - uniform draws samples from a uniform distribution over the interval [min,
# max] (ex: `selection_threshold`),
# - exponent draws x from a uniform distribution over the interval [min, max]
# and return $10^{-x}$ (ex: `learning_rate`),
# - randint returns an integer in [min, max] (ex: `n_conv_blocks`).

#The values of some variables are also fixed, meaning that they cannot be
#sampled and that they should be given a unique value.

# The values of the variables that can be set in random_search.toml correspond
# to the options of the train function.  Values of the Computational resources
# section can also be redefined using the command line. Some variables were also
# added to sample the architecture of the network.

# In the default dictionary, the learning rate will be sampled between $10^{-4}$
# and $10^{-6}$.

# This dictionary is written as a TOML  file in the `launch_dir` of the
# random-search.
# You can define differently other hyperparameters by looking at the
# [documentation](https://clinicadl.readthedocs.io/).

## Prerequisites

# You need to execute the [`clinicadl tsvtool
# getlabels`](TSVTools.md#getlabels---extract-labels-specific-to-alzheimers-disease)
# and [`clinicadl tsvtool
# {split|kfold}`](TSVTools.md#split---single-split-observing-similar-age-and-sex-distributions)
# commands prior to running this task to have the correct TSV file organization.
# Moreover, there should be a CAPS, obtained running the `t1-linear` pipeline of
# ClinicaDL.

# %%[markdown]
## Running the task

# This task can be run with the following command line:
# ```Text
# clinicadl random-search [OPTIONS] LAUNCH_DIRECTORY NAME
# ```
# where:

# - `launch_directory` (Path) is the parent directory of output folder
# containing the file `random_search.toml`.
# - `name` (str) is the name of the output folder containing the experiment.

# ## Content of `random_search.toml`

# `random_search.toml` must be present in `launch_dir` before running the
# command. 

# Mandatory variables:

# - `network_task` (str) is the task learnt by the network. 
#   Must be chosen between `classification` and `regression`
#   (random sampling for`reconstruction` is not implemented yet).
#   Sampling function: `fixed`.
# - `caps_directory` (str) is the input folder containing the neuroimaging data in a [CAPS](https://aramislab.paris.inria.fr/clinica/docs/public/latest/CAPS/Introduction/) hierarchy.
# Sampling function: `fixed`.
# - `preprocessing_json` (str) corresponds to the JSON file produced by
# `clinicadl extract` used for the search.  Sampling function: `fixed`.
# - `tsv_path` (str) is the input folder of a TSV file tree generated by
# `clinicadl tsvtool {split|kfold}`.  Sampling function: `fixed`.
# - `diagnoses` (list of str) is the list of the labels that will be used for
# training.  Sampling function: `fixed`.
# - `epochs` (int) is the [maximum number of
# epochs](Train/Details.md#stopping-criterion).  Sampling function: `fixed`.
# - `n_convblocks` (int) is the number of convolutional blocks in CNN.  Sampling
# function: `randint`.
# - `first_conv_width` (int) is the number of kernels in the first convolutional
# layer.  Sampling function: `choice`.
# - `n_fcblocks` (int) is the number of fully-connected layers at the end of the
# CNN.  Sampling function: `randint`.
#
# ## Train & evaluate a random network
# Based on the hyperparameter space described in `random_search.json`, you will
# now be able to train a random network. To do so the following command can be
# run:

# %%
!clinicadl random-search random_search maps_random_search2
# %% [markdown]
# A new folder `test` has been created in `launch_dir`. As for any network
# trained with ClinicaDL it is possible to evaluate its performance on a test
# set:
# %%
# Evaluate the network performance on the 2 test images
!clinicadl predict random_search/maps_random_search2 test --participant_tsv data/split/test.tsv --caps_directory data/synthetic --selection_metrics "loss" --no-gpu

# ## Analysis of the random network

# The architecture of the network can be retrieved from the `maps.json`
# file in the folder corresponding to a random job.

# The architecture can be fully retrieved with 4 keys:
# - `convolutions` is a dictionary describing each convolutional block,
# - `network_normalization` is the type of normalization layer used in
# convolutional blocks,
# - `n_fcblocks` is the number of fully-connected layers,
# - `dropout` is the dropout rate applied at the dropout layer.

# One convolutional block is described by the following values:
# - `in_channels` is the number of channels of the input (if set to null
# corresponds to the number of channels of the input data),
# - `out_channels` is the number of channels in the output of the convolutional
# block. It corresponds to 2 * `in_channels` except for the first channel chosen
# from `first_conv_width`, and if it becomes greater than `channels_limit`.
# - `n_conv` corresponds to the number of convolutions in the convolutional
# block,
# - `d_reduction` is the dimension reduction applied in the block.

# ### Convolutional block - example 1

# Convolutional block dictionary:
# ```python
# {
#     "in_channels": 16,
#     "out_channels": 32,
#     "n_conv": 2,
#     "d_reduction": "MaxPooling"
# }
# ```
# (`network_normalization` is set to `InstanceNorm`)

# ### Convolutional block - example 1

# Convolutional block dictionary:
# ```python
# {
#     "in_channels": 32,
#     "out_channels": 64,
#     "n_conv": 3,
#     "d_reduction": "stride"
# }
# ```
# (`network_normalization` is set to `BatchNorm`)

# A simple way to better visualize your random architecture is to construct it
# using `create_model` function from ClinicaDL. This function needs the list of
# options of the model stored in the JSON file as well as the size of the input.
