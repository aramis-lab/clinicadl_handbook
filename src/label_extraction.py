# # Define your population

# This notebook is an introduction to the tools proposed by ClinicaDL to
# identify relevant samples and to split them into coherent groups to be used
# during the training, the validation and the test stages.
#
# ```{important}
# This step is mandatory preliminary to training to avoid issues such as lack
# of clinical meaning or data leakage. 
# ```
#
# In the following, we will see how to split these samples between training,
# validation and test sets using tools available in `clinica` and `clinicadl`.


# %% [markdown]
# ## Before starting
# This notebook allows to prepare the dataset to train a neural network.

# These first two commands are the only ones that require access to the BIDS. If
# you were not able to process the data as indicated in the previous notebook,
# you can uncomment the following cell to download the BIDS of 4 subjects from
# OASIS-1 or the BIDS of 2 subjects from ADNI that were generated in the 
# [preprocessing section](./preprocessing.ipynb).

# %%
# #OASIS BIDS

# ## Get metadata from a BIDS hierarchy with `clinica iotools`
# ### Gather BIDS and CAPS data into a single TSV file
#
# In a BIDS hierarchy, demographic, clinical and imaging metadata are stored in
# TSV files located at different levels of the hierarchy depending on whether
# they are specific to a subject (e.g. gender), a session (e.g. diagnosis) or a
# scan (e.g. acquisitions parameters).

# The following command line can be used to merge all the metadata in a single
# TSV file:
# ```bash
# clinica iotools merge-tsv <bids_directory> <output_tsv>
# ```
# where:
# - `bids_directory` is the input folder containing the dataset in a BIDS
# hierarchy.
# - `output_tsv` is the path of the output tsv. If a directory is specified
# instead of a file name, the default name for the file created will be
# `merge-tsv.tsv`.

# %% [markdown]
# We are going to run some experiments on the ADNI and OASIS datasets, 
# if you have already downloaded the full datasets and converted them to 
# BIDS, you can set the path to the dataset directory by changing the 
# following paths. If not, just run it as written. Execute the following 
# command to gather metadata included in this BIDS.

# %%
# Merge meta-data information

# %% [markdown]
# ### Check missing modalities for each subject
#
# We want to restrict the list of sessions used to only include those with a 
# T1-MR image. The following command allows to identify which modalities are 
# available for each session:
#
# ```bash
# clinica iotools check-missing-modalities <bids_directory> <output_directory>
# ```
# where:
# - `bids_directory` is the input folder of a BIDS compliant dataset.
# - `output_directory` is the output folder.
#
# This pipeline does not have an option to give a list of subject/session, so it
# checks the missing modalities for all the datasets.
#
# Execute the following command to find which sessions include a T1-MR image on
# the example BIDS of OASIS:

# %%
# Find missing modalities
!clinica iotools check-missing-modalities data_oasis/BIDS_example data_oasis/missing_mods
# %%
!clinica iotools check-missing-modalities data_adni/BIDS_example data_adni/missing_mods
# %% [markdown]
# The output of this command, `missing_mods/`, is a folder with a series of
# files (one file per session label containing one row per subject and one
# column per modality).

# %% [markdown]
# ## Prepare metadata with `clinicadl tsvtools` 

# In this section we will work on a subset of 100 sessions of the OASIS dataset
# (and a subset of 100 sessions of the ADNI dataset) and you only need the list
# of the sessions, for now. 
#
# The whole preprocessing process has been run for you on these datasets. The
# results of the [quality check procedure](./preprocessing.html#quality-check-of-your-preprocessed-data) have been used
# to filter sessions. `data_oasis/oasis_after_qc.tsv` and `data_adni/adni_after_qc.tsv`
# store the list of the sessions that have been accepted for each dataset.
# 
# You can run the next cell to download the necessary resources
# (`merged.tsv` and `oasis_after_qc.tsv` - or `adni_after_qc.tsv` - files,
# as well as the `missing_mods` directory).

# ### Get the labels
#
# The 3 labels described in the [first part of the course](../clinical) (AD, CN,
# MCI) can be extracted with ClinicaDL using the command:
#
# ```bash
# clinicadl tsvtools get-labels <bids_directory> <results_tsv>
# ```
# where:
# - `bids_directory` the input folder containing the dataset in a BIDS
# hierarchy.
# - `results_tsv` is the path to the tsv file.

# ```{tip}
# You can increase the verbosity of the command by adding -v flag(s).
# ```

# The `bids_directory` argument is mandatory to run the `clinica iotools merge-tsv` 
# and `clinica iotools check-missing-modalities` within this pipeline if it has not 
# been done before. If you already have run these pipelines, the path is no longer 
# mandatory, and you can put anything, just add the options `--merged_tsv` and
# `--missing_mods`, to avoid re-running these pipelines.

# %% [markdown]
# By default the pipeline only extracts the AD and CN labels, which corresponds
# to the only available labels in OASIS. Run the following cell to extract them
# in a new file `labels.tsv` from the restricted version of OASIS:
# %%
!clinicadl tsvtools get-labels data_oasis/BIDS_example data_oasis --merged_tsv data_oasis/merged.tsv --missing_mods data_oasis/missing_mods --restriction_tsv data_oasis/oasis_after_qc.tsv
# %% [markdown]

# In the ADNI dataset, a subject can have several sessions during his follow-up 
# and so you can find another diagnosis, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). For more 
# information please refer to the [preprocessing section](./preprocessing.ipynb).
# Moreover, the BIDS example that you have downloaded doesn't label alzheimer's 
# disease as 'AD' but as 'Dementia' so you need to add the `--diagnosis`/`-d` 
# option.
# %%
!clinicadl tsvtools get-labels data_adni/BIDS_example data_adni --merged_tsv data_adni/merged.tsv --missing_mods data_adni/missing_mods --restriction_tsv data_adni/adni_after_qc.tsv -d CN -d Dementia -d MCI

# ### Analyze the population

# You may have noticed that there is a bias on age in the OASIS dataset: the youngest AD
# participant is 62 years old, whereas many CN participants are much younger. To correct this bias,
# we will exclude the youngest CN participants (i.e. who are less than 62 years old) from our data, 
# thanks to the following Python script:

# %%
from os import PathLike

def remove_youngest_cn(table_path: PathLike, minimum_age: int):
    """Remove youngest CN patients to correct age bias"""
    import pandas as pd

    table = pd.read_csv(table_path, sep='\t')
    new_table = table[(table['diagnosis'] == 'AD') | (table['age_bl'] >= minimum_age)]

    print(
        f"These participants were excluded from the dataset ({len(table) - len(new_table)} participants): \n\n", 
        table.loc[table.index.difference(new_table.index)]
        )
    
    new_table.to_csv(table_path, sep='\t')
# %%
remove_youngest_cn('data_oasis/labels.tsv', minimum_age=62)

# %% [markdown]
# However, other biases may exist, especially after the quality check of the 
# preprocessing which removed sessions from the dataset. Thus, it is crucial to 
# check before going further if there are other biases in the dataset.

# ClinicaDL implements a tool to perform a demographic and clinical analysis of
# the population:

# ```bash
# clinicadl tsvtools analysis <merged_tsv> <data_tsv> <results_path>
# ```
# where:
# - `merged_tsv` is the output file of the `clinica iotools merge-tsv` command.
# - `data_tsv` is the output file of `clinicadl tsvtool getlabels|split|kfold`.
# - `results_path` is the path to the tsv file that will be written (filename included).


# The following command will extract statistical values on the populations for
# each diagnostic label. Based on those, it is possible to check that the dataset
# is suitable for the classification task.

# ### Get the progression of the Alzheimer's disease
#
# For the ADNI dataset, because the dataset is longitudinal, the stability of the
# diagnostic status can be computed. The progression label corresponds to the
# following description: 
# - s (stable): diagnosis remains identical during the time_horizon period
# following the current visit, 
# - p (progressive): diagnosis progresses to the following state during the
# time_horizon period following the current visit (eg. MCI --> AD), 
# - r (regressive): diagnosis regresses to the previous state during the
# time_horizon period following the current visit (eg. MCI --> CN), 
# - uk (unknown): there are not enough sessions to assess the reliability of the
# label but no changes were spotted, 
# - us (unstable): otherwise (multiple conversions / regressions). 

# ClinicaDL implements a tool to get the progression label for each couple
# [subject, session] and adds a new column progression to the TSV file given as
# argument.

# ```bash
#   clinicadl tsvtools get-progression [OPTIONS] DATA_TSV
# ``` 
# with :
#  - `DATA_TSV` (str) is the TSV file containing the data (output of `clinicadl
#  tsvtools get-labels|split|kfold`).
#  - `--time_horizon` (int) can be added: It is the time horizon in months that
#  is used to assess the stability of the MCI subjects. Default value: 36.

# ```{tip}
# The diagnosis column do not need to be part of the columns, the pipeline will
# go back to the labels.tsv to calculate the progression
# ``` 

# %% [markdown]
# #### Run the pipeline on the ADNI dataset
# %%

# %%

# %% [markdown]
# ## Split the data samples into training, validation and test sets
#
# Now that the labels have been extracted and possible biases have been
# identified, the data has to be split in different sets. This step is essential to
# guarantee the independence of the final evaluation. 
#
# <div class="alert alert-block alert-info">
# <b>Definition of sets:</b><p>
#     In this notebook, data samples are divided between train, validation and
#     test sets:
# <ul>
#     <li> The <b>train set</b> is used to update the weights, </li>
#     <li> The <b>validation set</b> is used to stop the training process and select the best model, </li>
#     <li> The <b>test set</b> is used once the training process is finished, and is used to perform an unbiased evaluation of the performance of the model. </li>
# </ul>
#     <img src="../images/split.png">
#     <p>In the k-fold validation procedure, k trainings are conducted 
#       according to the k training/validation pairs generated. This 
#       leads to k different models that are evaluated on the test set 
#       once the training is finished. The final test performance is then 
#       the mean value of these k models.</p>
# </div>
#
# Tools that have been developed for this part are based on the guidelines of
# ([Varoquaux et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.10.038)).
#
# ### Build the test set
#
# The test set is obtained by performing a single split obtained with `clinicadl
# tsvtool split`:
#
# ```bash
# clinicadl tsvtool split <data_tsv>
# ```
# where:
# - `data_tsv` is the TSV file with the data that are going to be split
# (output of `clinicadl tsvtools get-labels|split|kfold`).
#
# Each diagnosis label is split independently. Random splits are generated 
# until the differences between age and sex distributions between the test 
# set and the train + validation set are non-significant. Then three TSV files
#  are written:
#
# - the baseline sessions of the test set,
# - the baseline sessions of the train + validation set,
# - the longitudinal sessions of the train + validation set.
#
# In OASIS there is no longitudinal follow-up, hence the last two TSV files are
# identical.

# Let's create a test set including 20% of the subjects:
# %% 
!clinicadl tsvtools split data_oasis/labels.tsv --n_test 0.2 --subset_name test 

# %% 
# for Adni dataset
!clinicadl tsvtools split data_adni/labels.tsv --n_test 0.2 --subset_name test 
# %% [markdown]
# The differences between the populations of the train + validation and test 
# sets can be assessed to check that there are no discrepancies between the 
# two sets.

# %%
!clinicadl tsvtools analysis data_oasis/merged.tsv data_oasis/split/train.tsv data_oasis/analysis_trainval.tsv
# %%
!clinicadl tsvtools analysis data_oasis/merged.tsv data_oasis/split/test_baseline.tsv data_oasis/analysis_test.tsv
# %%
print("Train + validation set")
display_table("data_oasis/analysis_trainval.tsv")
print("Test set")
display_table("data_oasis/analysis_test.tsv")
# %% [markdown]
# If you are not satisfied with these populations, you can relaunch the `clinicadl tsvtools split` command and
# change the parameters used to evaluate the difference between the
# distributions: `p_age_threshold` and `p_sex_threshold`.

# <div class="alert alert-block alert-info">
# <b>Unique test set:</b>
#     <p>Only one test set was created in (<a
#     href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1361841520300591">Wen
#     et al., 2020</a>) to evaluate the final performance of one model. This is
#     because architecture search was performed on the training + validation sets.
#     As this operation is very costly and/or is done mostly manually, it was not
#     possible to do it several times.</p>
# </div>
# %% [markdown]
# ### Build the validation sets
#
# To better estimate the performance of the network, it is trained 5 times using
# a 5-fold cross-validation procedure. In this procedure, each sample is used
# once to validate and the other times to train the network. In the same way as
# for the single split, the TSV files can be processed by  ClinicaDL:
#
# ```bash
# clinicadl tsvtool kfold <formatted_data_path>
# ```
#
# where `formatted_data_path` is the output tsv file of `clinicadl tsvtool get-labels|split|kfold`.

# In a similar way as for the test split, three tsv files are written
# **per split** for each set:

# - the baseline sessions of the validation set,
# - the baseline sessions of the train set,
# - the longitudinal sessions of the train set.

# Contrary to the test split, there is no attempt to control the similarity
# between the age and sex distributions. Indeed here we consider that averaging
# across the results of the 5 folds already reduces bias compared to a single
# data split.
# %%
!clinicadl tsvtools kfold data_oasis/split/train.tsv --n_splits 5 --subset_name validation

# %%
# for ADNI dataset
!clinicadl tsvtools kfold data_adni/split/train.tsv --n_splits 5 --subset_name validation
# %% [markdown]
# ### Check the absence of data leakage
#
# In OASIS-1 there is no risk of data leakage due to the data split itself as
# there is only one session per subject. Also, there is no MCI patients, hence
# there is no risk of data leakage during a transfer learning between a source
# task involving the MCI set and a target task involving at least one of its
# subsets (sMCI or pMCI). However, for other datasets, it might be useful to
# check that there is no correlated data spread between the train and test sets.
#
# A script in `clinicadl` has been created to check that there was no data
# leakage after the split steps. More specifically it checks that:
#
# 1. Baseline datasets contain only one scan per subject.
# 2. No intersection exists between train and test sets.
# 3. MCI train subjects are absent from test sets of subcategories of MCI.
    
# As it is not a common function, it has not been integrated to the general
# command line. The next cell executes it on the splits generated in the previous
# sections.
