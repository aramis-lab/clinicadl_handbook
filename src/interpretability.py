# # Generate saliency maps on trained networks

# Explaining black-box models can be useful to better understand their behavior.
# For more information on this complex topic, we highly recommend the review of
# [Xie et al.](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14545).

# In ClinicaDL, the most basic method of interpretability was implemented:
# [gradients visualization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6034.pdf) (sometimes
# called saliency maps). This method shows how the voxel intensities of an input
# image should be modified in order to increase the value of a particular output
# node.  Here the output nodes correspond to a label: the first one represents
# AD whereas the second represents CN.

# This method can be performed on an individual or on a group fashion (in this
# case it will be the mean value of all the individual saliency maps in the
# group).

# %% [markdown]
# ## Use of trivial datasets
#
# In the following, we are going to extract saliency maps from a model already
# trained on a large trivial synthetic dataset. The second line download the
# mask used for trivial data generation, so we can compare them to the saliency
# maps obtained.

## Generate individual saliency maps
#
# Saliency maps on corresponding to one image can be computed with the following
# command:
#
# ```bash
# clinicadl interpret [OPTIONS] INPUT_MAPS_DIRECTORY DATA_GROUP NAME METHOD
# ```
# where:
# - `input_maps_directory` is the path to the pretrained model folder,
# - `data_group` (str) is a prefix to name the files resulting from the interpretation task.
# - `name` is the name of the interpretability job.
# - `method` (str) is the name of the saliency method (gradients or grad-cam).

#```{warning}
# For ClinicaDL, a data group is linked to a list of participants / sessions and
# a CAPS directory.  When performing a prediction, interpretation or tensor
# serialization the user must give a data group.  If this data group does not
# exist, the user MUST give a caps_path and a tsv_path. If this data group 
# already exists, the user MUST not give any caps_path or tsv_path, or set
# overwrite to True.
# ```

# %% [markdown]
# In the following we chose to generate saliency map based on the opposite
# labels:
# - the first command loads AD images and generates saliency maps based on CN
# node, 
# - the second command loads CN images and generates saliency maps based on AD
# node,
#
# Choosing the target node can be interesting in multi-class problems, but in
# binary classification we expect the map of the opposite node to have opposite
# values than the ones in the corresponding node (that is not very interesting).

# This command will generate saliency maps for the model selected on validation 
# loss. You can obtain the same maps for the model selection on validation
# balanced accuracy by adding the option `--selection best_balanced_accuracy`.
#
# One map is generated per image in the folder `gradients/selection/<name>`.
# These images are organized in a similar way than the CAPS, with a
# `<participant_id>/<subject_id>` structure:

# %%
!tree interpret/maps_trivial/fold-0/gradients/best_loss/test-gc

# %% [markdown]
# Because we add the `--save_individual` option, we can plot the individual
# saliency maps to check which regions the CNN is focusing on.
# We can also plot the group saliency maps in the same way than for the
# individual ones.
